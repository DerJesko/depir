# Doubly-Efficient Private Information Retrival
## A prototype implementation of Lin-Mook-Wichs doubly-efficient private information retrieval in sage

I believe with some optimizations the recent doubly-efficient private information retrieval by Lin, Mook, and Wichs [https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1703]
can be made practically efficent. I'm prototyping the optimizations here.
